# Double-Ended Queue Implementation in Java

This project implements a double-ended queue (deque) in Java using a doubly linked list data structure. The deque supports various operations such as insertion, deletion, and observation at both ends of the list. Additionally, the project includes two scenarios demonstrating the practical applications of the deque data structure.

## Introduction

A double-ended queue (deque) is an ordered list of elements that allows insertion and deletion at both ends of the list. This implementation utilizes a doubly linked list to achieve dynamic growth capability and constant-time complexity for operations.

## Features

- **Deque Operations**: The implemented deque supports the following operations:
  - Insertion at the front and back of the deque.
  - Removal from the front and back of the deque.
  - Observation of elements at the front and back of the deque.
  - Retrieval of the size of the deque.
  - Checking if the deque is empty.

- **Game Simulation**: Simulates the ability to reverse operations in a game using the deque. Demonstrates undo functionality and history tracking in a game environment.

- **Exhibition Queue Simulation**: Simulates the waiting time in a queue for visitors at an exhibition hall. Calculates the average waiting time for regular visitors and responsible visitors over a simulated period.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/double-ended-queue.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd double-ended-queue
   ```

3. Compile and run the Java programs:
   ```
   javac Run.java
   java Run
   ```

## Usage

- To play the game simulation, follow the instructions prompted in the console. Enter numbers 1-8 to make moves, 9 to undo, and 0 to exit and display the history of movements.

- To simulate the exhibition queue, run the `Main` class. The program will output the average waiting time for regular visitors and responsible visitors after the simulation.
